This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

With this project I showcase my abilities with Nextjs, Typescript , React and Node JS.

This Project is a simple News aggregator using the New York Times api .
